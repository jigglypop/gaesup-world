## introduction

Gaesup World is a library that uses @react/three-fiber, @react/three-drei, and rapier to provide control tools for characters, airplanes, cars, and more in a web 3D environment. This controller is designed to easily manage character movement, animation, and interaction. It allows for easy manipulation of characters or vehicles in a virtual world, and is also equipped with utilities like minimaps and joysticks.

### Features

- 3D character control based on React Three Fiber.
- Simple API for controlling character movement and animation.
- Extensible structure for various customizations.
- Lightweight library for fast loading and performance optimization.

### Installation

```bash
npm install @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei three @types/three @react-three/rapier gaesup-world
```

Or

```bash
yarn add @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei three @types/three @react-three/rapier gaesup-world
```
